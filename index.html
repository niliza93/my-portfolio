Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace were essential for creating documents, managing emails with Outlook, and collaborating through Teams and SharePoint Online. I used Zoom for virtual meetings, Canva for creating presentations and marketing materials, and Microsoft Project for planning projects. I also used Bambee for HR tasks, Homebase for team scheduling and time tracking, and Outlook for managing emails and appointments. These tools helped me support the CEO and the team effectively, ensuring everything ran smoothly in a remote work setting.

		    	<p class="px-md-5">During my two-month journey at Zuitt Coding Bootcamp, I learned a diverse set of tools essential for modern web development. In frontend development, I mastered HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, which helped me create visually appealing and responsive user interfaces. I also explored backend development with JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express to build server-side applications. 
		    	</p>
		    	<p class="col-12 px-md-5">I used tools like Sublime Text for coding and Postman for API testing and debugging. I learned React to connect frontend and backend functionalities, making me a full-stack developer. Additionally, I worked with Git and GitLab for version control and collaboration, ensuring efficient project management. Through hands-on projects and mentorship, Zuitt gave me the skills and confidence to navigate the world of web development.</p>
